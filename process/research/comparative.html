      <p>While researching what was already existed on the web in terms of hydration sites, I stumbled across many articles and "top facts" blogs. Not very many people seemed to have made interactive websites discussing the importance of hydration. Some of the more interactive sites I found had one thing in common; they all featured some kind of "smart bottle" which, when connected to an app downloaded on your phone, tracked your hydration for you. H2OPal was one of the most aesthetic and functional websites I found advertising its own "smart bottle". While the design of the site was clean, functional, and beautiful, the product they advertised seemed a little over-the-top in terms of spreading awareness about hydration. Hydration is a simple enough topic that, when armed with the correct knowledge, shouldn't take a human to rely on a "smart bottle" that simply remembers their water intake for them.</p>
      <p>H2OPal's website includes full spread images that add a certain sleekness and refinement to the simple idea of drinking water for health. Their models all look healthy and fit, seemingly due to the presence of this fancy "smart bottle" in their lives. Scrolling down the website, various functionalities and features of the app are made obvious through icons and short descriptions, but there isn't too much extra information that clutters up the design space (as we often see happening in articles about hydration). The website's minimalist monochrome blue color scheme fits with its intent to promote hydration but the morals of the mission are a little detracted by the fact that they are still trying to sell you a product. Overall, I believe the website's aesthetic is appropriate to a modern take on hydration, but its content is lacking in terms of both education and awareness.</p>

      <p>Waterlogic's website is a foil to H2OPal's in that it focuses more on the facts and science to discuss the importance of hydration. Waterlogic utilizes blog posts about water and its effect on human health as well as the health of the earth. Their imagery has a more scientific and medical feel to it to give their site the allusion of credibility, and it indeed seems more legitimate than H2OPal in the sense that they seem to focus more on figures and scientifically proven facts. Their website, however, isn't as streamlined as the H2OPal website. Indeed, there is much to explore visiting Waterlogic, but their site lacks direction and organization. It takes a few clicks before realizing what Waterlogic even is. Further exploration reveals that they are indeed selling services and products, all to do with the water consumption of businesses. This is more marketed towards people who are starting a business and want to use ethical practices.</p>
      <p>While Waterlogic's website does focus more on the moral aspects of the importance of water and hydration, I think they feel to appeal to a younger and wider audience with their lack of streamlined design. Many viewers would lose interest before even getting down to the core of what Waterlogic stands for. What I do enjoy about their website is how credible it is in terms of content and sources. I want a website that I create to make the audience feel like they've learned legitimate facts, and Waterlogic indeed accomplishes that task by including important information in their articles and blog posts.</p>
