      <h1>To the right is my brainstorm for the 2019 Creativity & Cognition conference being held in San Diego, CA. The Creativity & Cognition conference focuses on using "design interactive techniques and tools that mindfully and ethically augment and amplify human creativity for social good across all human endeavors" (<a href="https://cc.acm.org/2019/" alt = "C&C 2019 Website">C&C 2019 Website</a>). I chose to focus on social goods that were relevant to modern society as well as important to my own ideologies while brainstorming ideas for this conference.</h1>
